## üåè Air Pollution Data Analysis in India

This project focuses on analyzing air quality data from different regions of India using Python. The dataset includes key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, CO, and O‚ÇÉ, which are widely used as indicators of air quality.

The analysis covers data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualizations to better understand pollution trends. It highlights seasonal and yearly variations, compares pollution levels across major cities, and explores the correlation between pollutants.

### Key Features

* Cleaning and preprocessing raw air quality data

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with statistical summaries

* Visualization of pollution levels over time

* Seasonal and yearly trend analysis

* City-wise comparisons of air quality

* Correlation study among pollutants

### Tools and Libraries

* Python

* pandas, numpy

* matplotlib, seaborn


### Insights

The project provides a clearer picture of how pollution levels change across seasons and regions in India. It shows patterns such as higher PM2.5 levels in winter months and differences between cities, as well as relationships between different pollutants. These insights can support awareness, research, and potential policy discussions.

### Future Work

Build predictive models to forecast pollution levels

Create an interactive dashboard with Streamlit or Dash

Incorporate real-time data from external air quality APIs
