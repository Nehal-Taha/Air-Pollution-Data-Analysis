🌏 Air Pollution Data Analysis in India

This project analyzes air pollution data from India using Python to uncover trends, seasonal variations, and city-wise differences in air quality. The dataset contains key pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, and O₃, which are crucial indicators of air quality and public health.

The main objective is to understand how air pollution changes across time and regions and to highlight critical insights that can support awareness, policymaking, and further research on environmental challenges.

🔍 Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, formatting, and preparing raw data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, seasonal effects, and anomalies in pollution levels.

Visualization: Charts and plots to show yearly, monthly, and city-wise variations.

City Comparisons: Evaluating air quality across major Indian cities.

Correlation Analysis: Studying relationships among pollutants to detect patterns.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

pandas – data manipulation

numpy – numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – data visualization

(Optional) scikit-learn – predictive analysis

📈 Insights

The analysis reveals how pollution levels fluctuate across seasons (e.g., winter spikes in PM2.5), compares the most polluted cities, and highlights correlations among pollutants. These insights provide valuable context for environmental researchers, policymakers, and the public.

🚀 Future Improvements

Add predictive modeling to forecast pollution levels.

Develop an interactive dashboard with Streamlit or Dash.

Integrate real-time data from air quality APIs.

🎯 Goal

This project demonstrates how data science can be applied to real-world environmental issues. By analyzing air pollution in India, it provides actionable insights and serves as a foundation for further research in climate and public health.
